    Below the thunders of the upper deep,<br/>
    Far, far beneath in the abysmal sea,<br/>
    His ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep<br/>
    The Kraken sleepeth: faintest sunlights flee<br/>
    About his shadowy sides; above him swell<br/>
    Huge sponges of millennial growth and height;<br/>
    And far away into the sickly light,<br/>
    From many a wondrous and secret cell<br/>
    Unnumber'd and enormous polypi<br/>
    Winnow with giant arms the lumbering green.<br/>
    There hath he lain for ages, and will lie<br/>
    Battening upon huge sea-worms in his sleep,<br/>
    Until the latter fire shall heat the deep;<br/>
    Then once by man and angels to be seen,<br/>
    In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die.<br/>
    â€” "The Kraken" by Alfred Lord Tennyson, 1830

<p>This is Squid CafÃ©, a special (to me) Mastodon instance.</p>

<!-- <p>What is Mastodon? Check out <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">joinmastodon.org</a>. In essence, Mastodon is a decentralized, open source social network.</p> -->

<p>It is not focused on any particular niche interest, however, I am a fountain pen user/collector, hence the semi-related "squid" name. (Squid. Ink. Get it?) Also... Cephalopods. Analog/digital photography, science. Itâ€™s all good. Everyone is welcome as long as you follow the code of conduct.</p>
<p>I'm still working out some kinks, so I hope you don't mind some occasional down-time.</p>
